                    Hello, I'm Lebo Kharafu, a third-year Computer Science student at University of Witswatersrand. My passion for
                    technology and problem-solving has driven me to explore: Software Development & Design, Cybersecurity, Creative Coding, and recently Machine Learning, where I
                    continuously seek to enhance my skills and knowledge.

                    I have experience working with [Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, Delphi, SQL; Express, Node, Okhttp, Json; 
                    Git, Github, Linux, Java-Swing, Netbeans, Android-Studio, Qt-Creator, Scene-Builder, VsCode, Ms-Office], and I have developed
                    projects involving [This Porfolio-site, School-Projects, others below]. One of my recent
                    projects, [TimeMan], focused on [Time mnagement for students].

                    Beyond academics, I am actively involved in [ENC-Leadership, Rotary-Dunamis-Interact]. These
                    experiences have helped me develop strong [Communication,Soft-Skills]
                    while collaborating with peers on innovative solutions.

                    I am driven by a curiosity to solve complex problems and a commitment to continuous learning. My
                    goal is to [Earn a Turing Award in Computer Sceince Research, Open a startUp mainly amimed to Train High Schoolers to Code/Develop/Maintain software]. 
                    I am always eager to take on new challenges and connect with like-minded individuals to create impactful solutions.
